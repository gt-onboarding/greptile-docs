title: Code Review Bot
description: "Greptile reviews your pull/merge requests with codebase context-aware comments"
---

<Note>Both GitHub & GitLab supported</Note>

Greptile's code review bot does two things:

1. summarizes the changes in the pull/merge request

2. comments on specific file changes suggests potential issues and unforeseen consequences of the change.

### Why is it useful?

Greptile's code review bot writes comments that:

- Are context-aware, so can discuss the implications of the changes to the wider codebase.
- Can address potential security or compliance issues produced by the changes.
- Summarize the changes with codebase context, making it far easier for a human reviewer to contextualize and parse the changes.
- Reference similar code or abstractions related to the changes that are already in the codebase, to prevent repitition.

This means less time spent reviewing PRs or awaiting review, and more time spent writing code.

### Configuration

Configuration options include:

1. Setting up triggers, for example `@mentions`, or certain filters like workspace, project, team, or label.
2. Setting target repositories for the bot to review PRs for.
3. Providing "special instructions" for the bot to follow, for example, "Include a section on compliance implications of the changes in the PR."
4. Selecting certain criterion for the bot to evaluate each diff on, for example syntax issues, or style guide violations.

Greptile can be configured to trigger a review:

1. For all PRs
2. For PRs in certain workspaces, projects, teams, or with certainlabels
3. For PRs that mention `@greptileai` in the body
4. Every time a new commit is made on a PR branch
